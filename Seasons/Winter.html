		<h1>WINTER</h1>
		<p>Winter is a season of contrasts, where the world transforms into a serene and often frosty wonderland. The days are shorter, and the nights grow longer, inviting us to cozy up indoors by a roaring fire. The temperatures drop, and snowfall blankets the ground, creating a pristine and magical scenery. Nature appears dormant, with trees shedding their leaves and animals hibernating in search of warmth. People engage in winter sports like skiing, ice skating, and building snowmen. Winter is a season of stillness and introspection, allowing us to appreciate the beauty of a frozen landscape and find comfort in the quietude of the season.</p>
