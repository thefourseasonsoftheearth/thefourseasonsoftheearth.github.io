		<h1>SPRING</h1>
		<p>Spring marks the transition from the cold and dreary winter to a fresh and vibrant new season. As the sun gradually becomes stronger and the days grow longer, nature starts to awaken from its slumber. Trees and flowers begin to bloom, filling the landscape with an array of colors and fragrances. The air becomes filled with a sense of rejuvenation, and animals emerge from hibernation to forage for food and start their mating rituals. Spring is a season of hope and new beginnings, symbolizing growth, rebirth, and the promise of warmer days ahead.</p>
